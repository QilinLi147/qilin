I am deeply honoured to announce that I have been awarded two prestigious scholarships in December 2025:

- **National Scholarship for Doctoral Students (2025)** 
- **Presidential Scholarship, South China University of Technology**
- 
The National Scholarship for Doctoral Students is one of the highest honours bestowed upon graduate students in China, recognising outstanding academic achievement and research contributions. The Presidential Scholarship is awarded by South China University of Technology to acknowledge exceptional performance in doctoral studies.

I am grateful for this recognition and remain committed to advancing research in affective computing and machine learning.
