We are pleased to announce that our paper *"DGC-Link: Dual-Gate Chebyshev Linkage Network on EEG Emotion Recognition"* has been accepted for publication in **IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing**.

The paper introduces a novel dual-gate Chebyshev Linkage network (DGC-Link) for EEG-based emotion recognition, addressing key challenges in capturing complex EEG signal information. The proposed method achieves superior recognition performance:

- **96.43%** accuracy on the SEED dataset (differential entropy classification)
- **98.58%** and **97.62%** for valence, arousal, and dominance classifications on DREAMER
- **78.48%** and **44.93%** for 3-class and 7-class classifications on MPED

The paper will appear in Volume 16, Issue 4 (Oct.-Dec. 2025).
