We are delighted to announce that our paper *"MCGC-Net: Multi-scale Controllable Graph Convolutional Network on Music Emotion Recognition"* has been accepted for early access publication in **IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing**.

This work introduces a novel dynamic graph learning approach for frequency graphs, underpinned by the Multi-scale Controllable Graph Convolutional Network (MCGC-net). The approach addresses key challenges in capturing global and local correlations in music signals for emotion recognition tasks.

**Key achievements:**

- **79.03%** and **70.05%** for Arousal and Valence on 1000songs dataset
- **85.81%** and **75.42%** on PMEmo dataset
- **79.52%** and **78.61%** on Memo2496 dataset

The frequency graph-based approach integrates timbre and chroma audio features, whilst the graph feature extractor module employs control units and shortcut connections to enhance hierarchical feature dissemination and remote node attribute depiction.
